# Sprint 5 – Pipeline Optimization & Production Polish
**Duration:** 1 week
**Goal:** Optimize 5-stage pipeline performance, resume logic, and production features.

| ID | Task |
|----|------|
| SP5‑01 | `resume_incomplete_jobs()` with 5-stage pipeline state recovery. |
| SP5‑02 | Detail page: Copy‑to‑Clipboard + Download with pipeline metrics display. |
| SP5‑03 | **Enhanced**: Guardrail optimization using hallucination detection feedback. |
| SP5‑04 | SSE progress refinements for 5-stage pipeline + pipeline stage indicators. |
| SP5‑05 | Load‑test 5-stage pipeline (10 parallel generations) + performance optimization. |
| SP5‑06 | **NEW**: Pipeline performance monitoring and advisor AI effectiveness metrics. |
| SP5‑07 | **NEW**: Knowledge base optimization based on hallucination patterns. |
| SP5‑08 | Acceptance tests: end‑to‑end with 5-stage pipeline; crash‑resume for each stage. |

## **Pipeline Performance Optimizations**
- **Stage Caching**: Cache RAG queries for common cmdlets
- **Parallel Processing**: Stages 2+4 can run in parallel when appropriate
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation if stages fail
- **Metrics Collection**: Track stage performance and accuracy

## **Enhanced Monitoring**
```
Pipeline Metrics:
├── Stage 1: Instruction processing time + cmdlet prediction accuracy
├── Stage 2: RAG query time + documentation relevance scores
├── Stage 3: Script generation time + initial quality metrics
├── Stage 4: Hallucination detection time + issue identification rate
└── Stage 5: Correction time + advisor effectiveness rate
```

**Enhanced DoD** • All acceptance tests pass with 5-stage pipeline • Performance targets met • Self-correction effectiveness >85%.
