| SP5‑03 | **Enhanced**: Guardrail optimization using hallucination detection feedback. | Done |
| SP5‑04 | SSE progress refinements for 5-stage pipeline + pipeline stage indicators. | To Do |
| SP5‑05 | Load‑test 5-stage pipeline (10 parallel generations) + performance optimization. | To Do |
| SP5‑06 | **NEW**: Pipeline performance monitoring and advisor AI effectiveness metrics. | To Do |
| SP5‑07 | **NEW**: Knowledge base optimization based on hallucination patterns. | Done |
| SP5‑08 | Acceptance tests: end‑to‑end with 5-stage pipeline; crash‑resume for each stage. | To Do |

## **Pipeline Performance Optimizations**
- **Stage Caching**: Cache RAG queries for common cmdlets
- **Metrics Collection**: Track stage performance and accuracy

## **Enhanced Monitoring**
```
Pipeline Metrics:
├── Stage 1: Instruction processing time + cmdlet prediction accuracy
├── Stage 2: RAG query time + documentation relevance scores
├── Stage 3: Script generation time + initial quality metrics
├── Stage 4: Hallucination detection time + issue identification rate
└── Stage 5: Correction time + advisor effectiveness rate
```

**Enhanced DoD** • All acceptance tests pass with 5-stage pipeline • Performance targets met • Self-correction effectiveness >85%.
