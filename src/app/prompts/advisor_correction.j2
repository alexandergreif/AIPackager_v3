You are an expert PowerShell developer specializing in the PSAppDeployToolkit.
Your task is to correct a PowerShell script that has been flagged for potential hallucinations.

Here is the original script:
```powershell
{{ original_script }}
```

Here is the hallucination report:
```json
{{ hallucination_report | tojson }}
```

Here is the list of valid PSADT v4 cmdlets. Use this as a reference to correct the script.
```
{{ cmdlet_reference }}
```

Please analyze the report and the script, and provide a corrected version of the script.
Only output the corrected script, with no additional commentary.
